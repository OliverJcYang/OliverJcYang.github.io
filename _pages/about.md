# About Me

Hello! I'm Jingcheng Yang, a dedicated and analytical individual currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Decision Analytics with a minor in Finance at The University of Hong Kong. I am set to graduate in May 2025 and will continue my studies with a Master of Wealth Management at HKU Business School.

## Education

I have a strong academic foundation in mathematics, statistics, and finance, having completed selected courses in numerical analysis, statistical machine learning, corporate finance, and investment analysis. My education equips me with the tools to tackle complex financial problems and make data-driven decisions.

## Professional Experience

I have gained valuable experience through internships in various sectors:

- **CSOP Asset Management (Summer Intern, Product & Client Strategy):** I prepared daily reports for clients, analyzed market trends, and assisted in creating sales materials.
  
- **TF International Securities (Intern, Global Market):** My role involved summarizing market updates and providing insights into macroeconomic data, supporting the trading desk with detailed analysis.

- **Huatai Securities (Summer Intern, Equity Research Team):** I conducted in-depth research on the semiconductor industry, produced comprehensive reports, and identified investment opportunities, notably recommending TSMC as a buy.

- **Shenzhen Securities Information (Summer Intern, Index Market Division):** I analyzed the SZSE Component Index and compared it against key benchmark indices, enhancing my understanding of market dynamics.

## Extra-Curricular Activities

I am passionate about giving back to the community, as demonstrated by my volunteer work at Johns Hopkins University, where I helped distribute food and clothing to those in need. Additionally, I completed a challenging hiking mission as part of The Duke of Edinburghâ€™s International Award, navigating wilderness terrain without modern conveniences.

## Skills and Interests

I am proficient in English, Mandarin, and have basic knowledge of Cantonese. My technical skills include programming in Python, C, and C++, alongside expertise in Microsoft Office and Bloomberg. In my free time, I enjoy table tennis, tennis, swimming, and hiking.
